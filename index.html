					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Thomas Haddon and I am a first year bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University in Australia. I was born here in the south side of Melbourne in Sandringham where I spent the first 3 years of my life, before moving to Phuket in Thailand for 7 years where I began my education from kindergarten all the way to year 4. I then moved to Singapore where I spent the next 8 years of my life going through middle school and high school. In high school I completed the International Baccalaureate, which is an intense 2 year course for the last two years of high school intended to help the student prepare for university. Ethnically I am half Australian and half Indonesian, at home I spoke english with my father and bahasa with my mother. Over the course of my time in school I took courses in French and Spanish and can hold basic conversation in both languages effectively. Because all of my time being abroad outside of Australia, my entire life I have been in international schools. I have interacted with all walks of life from around the world which I am truly grateful for because this has broadened my understanding of many different cultures and traditions. Some of my favourite hobbies include staying physically active by playing rugby and going to the gym regularly. In my free time I love to play video games with my friends or going out and discovering new restaurants with great food.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT stemmed from PC gaming initially when I was 10 years old and wanted to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive. From there I began learning about PC hardware from the likes of LinusTechTips and GamersNexus where I first learnt how a PC was built. This then snowballed into learning about what each component in a PC does and its purpose, learning how performance of a PC is measured through different applications. Whether it would be through 3Dmark to test the overall performance and get an average or through cinebench to get a quantifiable number of the performance of both the CPU and GPU. My interest in IT now is to learn about the software side. Through this course I want to be proficient in both coding and learning about creating IT systems for applications and services. I hope to be a software developer after university to help create more efficient and usable software for all demographics using any sort of application.</p>

					<p>My reason for coming to RMIT is simply because I read about how great the university is for its IT course compared to other universities in Melbourne. My parents wanted me to go back to Australia for university so that I can experience the country I was born in after living most of my life in Asia and not having the chance to really experience the culture here. Another reason is that I can be closer to my families in both Australia and Indonesia rather than being halfway across the world, leading to me rarely being able to come back to my family. Another reason for coming to RMIT, is the location of the university being in the city. Being in the city is highly convenient and also a great way to experience life here in Melbourne to both socialise and explore the city.</p>

					<p>My expectations throughout the course as previously stated, is learning to be proficient in coding and learning about the different IT systems and how to manage them. I also want to develop myself as an individual and reflect upon myself about what I did well and how it can be improved upon. I would like to also work on my skills as a critical thinker and through programming I believe this can be achieved. Programming poses the aspects as to how to solve problems using critical thinking, because in programming there can be multiple ways to solve a question and not one fixed solution. This interest in problem solving propels me to push myself in anything I do and to not be discouraged for example if my code doesn't work to complete the task it is designed to do. I would go back and try again and solve why it may not be working.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Senior Software Engineer - Accessibility</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This position of software engineer at Discord specifically entails working on the accessibility aspects of discord ensuring that everyone is able to use the application, making the experience of using discord much more pleasant for the user. This position interests me because it works on the user's experience and I particularly enjoy making experiences for other people if possible just a little bit better for everyone. I believe that this can be done through this position.  With the help of user centered design which is a class I have undertaken, I can apply my experience of learning UX to help make discord an overall better experience. The Job also offers many benefits for it’s employees such as gym membership, insurance and developmental workshops which promotes personal growth. These benefits incites the employee to have a more healthy work life balance which is highly desirable in the workforce. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Currently I do not have the skills required to apply for this position.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The job entails that the employee will be working with Android and IOS devices which will require an understanding and competency in Swift and Java.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>A way that these requirements can be met is through studying and building these skills outside of class whenever possible. But first a good building block to help obtain these skills is through RMIT’s programming courses to help build a solid foundation to approach and learn these languages. RMIT also offers an IOS programming course which will be highly beneficial to help build these skills and meet the qualifications for the job. </p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
				<img src="gandalf.png" alt="Gandalf" />
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>The Myers Briggs is a reflective questionnaire that shows the different psychological preferences of people and how they perceive the world around them. The tests divides up the traits of the individual into 4 categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>According to the test, the strengths of this personality type is that Architects are supposedly rational in their way of thinking. This personality type is supposedly known for forming rational and evidence-based opinions. The test showed that Architects are independent in their work and are determined to achieve their goals in whatever type of work they are doing.</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>The test claims that Architects are arrogant in their ways of knowledge. They can be rather harsh when it comes to a dispute of trying to prove someone wrong. Architects can be dismissive of emotions, this can lead to in-fighting within groups if for example they are overly-critical of someone's work or contribution.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>Architects within team compositions apparently do not tend to work well due to the supposed arrogance of the personality because they would much rather work alone to accomplish their goal. If for example the quality of work does not meet the standard this only sets back the group with time in order to bring said quality of work up to a higher standard.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>The learning test was taken from www.how-to-study.com. The results showed that I am a tactile/kinesthetic learner, which I find to be true. I tend to learn a lot better and faster if I were to complete the task myself. I learn a lot by making those mistakes in the tasks I do and then going back and reattempting. This is very evident when playing video games for example. If I were to fail a level or make a mistake in a competitive game, I will go back and try again until I do succeed. Within a team setting this would work well I believe because through trial and error we could work together to fix an issue or bug within a program for example. When forming a team I believe there should be a good mix of different kinds of learners as for they may have different opinions on ideas or they may approach them differently. This is good to help try different ideas and see what works best for everyone and maybe find the most efficient idea to help accomplish the task. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
					<p>The test was taken from www.truity.com. The results showed that my scores on the OCEAN graph were: O = 58%, C=60%, E=35%, A=79%, N=67%. What these results mean to me is that they somewhat explain my personality traits. The way I see myself as a person may not reflect what the tests show. The results do somewhat accurately show who I am as a person, for example the agreeableness trait is true in that I enjoy being helpful and empathetic of others. I tend to find myself putting others before me quite often when it comes to everyday life. Whenever my friends may need help with something, I will stop whatever I'm doing or complete what I'm doing and go and help them to the best of my ability. These results show that as a person I can work well in a team because I want to cooperate and help others out if they are in need of any form of help. I am willing to go the extra mile to help them out. I will get my work done myself and make sure the quality of work is up to a standard that is good.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>For this project, the idea is to create an analytical tool for the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive(CSGO) which shows the heatmap of player activity in the map de_mirage. To explain what CSGO is, CSGO is a 30 round(first to 16) 5v5 competitive objective based tactical shooter. In the game there are two opposing teams composed of the counter-terrorists (CT’s) and terrorists (T’s). The objective of the terrorists is to plant and detonate a bomb at one of two specified bomb sites. The objective of the counter-terrorists is to prevent that from happening. The objective of this project is to show it’s users the general player tendencies of where players from both team’s interact with one another, where team fights happen and what utility is most frequently utilised throughout a round. From this data the player can make a more informed decision when either attacking a site or which site to focus their defenses.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The motivation for this project is to help more new players starting the game to learn the game more efficiently using the data to make better decisions in game. On average in the last 30 days CS GO has over 749,847 players(Steamcharts,2012) and is continually growing steadily every month. This indicates that there is a market for new players joining the community of players every month and may perhaps would like to receive some help when starting out the game. This tool may be used as a stepping stone to help these players get started and learn the basics of where players tend to go and help them learn a new map faster.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The features of this tool will include as previously stated a heatmap showing where both sides of CT’s and T’ engage one another, showing the tendencies of where CT’s prefer to defend on the specified areas on a site and where the T’s prefer to attack from. This tool will also take data of which side uses more specific utility such as grenades, smokes, flashes and in which specific time in the game. CS GO uses an in game economy system to manage weapons and utility for both sides. This means the more a team wins rounds the more money in the economy will be available to that specific side. However to counteract this a in-game feature known as a loss bonus is given to the team that loses the round and stacks up to 4 rounds. The tool should be able to show what are the preferred purchases during the pistol round(this is the first round of each half), a half buy(buying rifles and armour but no grenades), a full buy(buying armour, rifles, and grenades).</p>
					 <p>Using a heatmap can show where a side would fail most often giving the player an idea of where he or she would most likely fail if they were to defend a site from a specific position or T’s where they would most likely fail if they were to attack from a certain route. Another feature of this tool would be to inform the CT player if they should be buying a defuse kit or not (a defuse kit reduces the time of defusing the bomb from 5 seconds to 10 seconds). This is a crucial piece of utility for CT players as many games have been won or lost depending if the player bought a defuse kit or not. This would mean the tool would also show when during the game the bomb is most likely to be planted.</p>
					 <p> However the question is what level of skill should be used as data for this tool. In the game there are over 18 ranks, the lowest being involving the newest players and the highest rank including players that have put in countless hours into the game. The data should be taken from a wide range of players from every rank to give the most accurate data of player tendencies. Perhaps another feature would be to show the user specific rank heatmaps as more experienced players would play the game differently compared to newer players.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The software to be used would be python and CSGO, the python script would intake the data from CS GO rounds and compile the heat maps onto a map of de_mirgae showing the user visually the data. The hardware that would be used is any computer that can be powerful enough to run python scripts and can compile thousands upon thousands of rounds of Counter Strike as this would be necessary if the data of over 18 ranks were to be taken from.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills required for this project would be proficiency in python, this can be developed over time during the duration of the course and is further developed in RMIT’s introduction to programming which teaches the course in python. The feasibility of this is rather probable as assignment 3 is due in 2 months and over the course of 2 months my understanding of python will be more defined.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The outcome of this project if successful there will be a program that can show users a heatmap of the map de_mirage in CS GO and other useful data that further informs the player to make better decisions when playing the game. This will be a tool very useful for new players learning maps in this case being de_mirage. The impact of this would be rather insignificant as for the majority of players playing CS GO have already been playing for many years and this project would be aimed at a niche demographic. This would also raise the issue of how to get this program known to these new players. Overall this project will be a learning experience for those being involved in this project as a majority of students in this course are rather new to programming and will be a good challenge. </p>
