					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Thomas Haddon and I am a first year bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University in Australia. I was born here in the south side of Melbourne in Sandringham where I spent the first 3 years of my life, before moving to Phuket in Thailand for 7 years where I began my education from kindergarten all the way to year 4. I then moved to Singapore where I spent the next 8 years of my life going through middle school and high school. In high school I completed the International Baccalaureate, which is an intense 2 year course for the last two years of high school intended to help the student prepare for university. Ethnically I am half Australian and half Indonesian, at home I spoke english with my father and bahasa with my mother. Over the course of my time in school I took courses in French and Spanish and can hold basic conversation in both languages effectively. Because all of my time being abroad outside of Australia, my entire life I have been in international schools. I have interacted with all walks of life from around the world which I am truly grateful for because this has broadened my understanding of many different cultures and traditions. Some of my favourite hobbies include staying physically active by playing rugby and going to the gym regularly. In my free time I love to play video games with my friends or going out and discovering new restaurants with great food.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT stemmed from PC gaming initially when I was 10 years old and wanted to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive. From there I began learning about PC hardware from the likes of LinusTechTips and GamersNexus where I first learnt how a PC was built. This then snowballed into learning about what each component in a PC does and its purpose, learning how performance of a PC is measured through different applications. Whether it would be through 3Dmark to test the overall performance and get an average or through cinebench to get a quantifiable number of the performance of both the CPU and GPU. My interest in IT now is to learn about the software side. Through this course I want to be proficient in both coding and learning about creating IT systems for applications and services. I hope to be a software developer after university to help create more efficient and usable software for all demographics using any sort of application.</p>

					<p>My reason for coming to RMIT is simply because I read about how great the university is for its IT course compared to other universities in Melbourne. My parents wanted me to go back to Australia for university so that I can experience the country I was born in after living most of my life in Asia and not having the chance to really experience the culture here. Another reason is that I can be closer to my families in both Australia and Indonesia rather than being halfway across the world, leading to me rarely being able to come back to my family. Another reason for coming to RMIT, is the location of the university being in the city. Being in the city is highly convenient and also a great way to experience life here in Melbourne to both socialise and explore the city.</p>

					<p>My expectations throughout the course as previously stated, is learning to be proficient in coding and learning about the different IT systems and how to manage them. I also want to develop myself as an individual and reflect upon myself about what I did well and how it can be improved upon. I would like to also work on my skills as a critical thinker and through programming I believe this can be achieved. Programming poses the aspects as to how to solve problems using critical thinking, because in programming there can be multiple ways to solve a question and not one fixed solution. This interest in problem solving propels me to push myself in anything I do and to not be discouraged for example if my code doesn't work to complete the task it is designed to do. I would go back and try again and solve why it may not be working.</p>

					<p>This position of software engineer specifically entails working on the accessibility aspects of discord ensuring that everyone is able to use the application, making the experience of using discord much more pleasant for the user. This position interests me because it works on the user's experience and I particularly enjoy making experiences for other people if possible just a little bit better for everyone. I believe that this can be done through this position.  With the help of user centered design which is a class I have undertaken, I can apply my experience of learning UX to help make discord an overall better experience.

					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>A way that these requirements can be met is through studying and building these skills outside of class whenever possible. But first a good building block to help obtain these skills is through RMIT’s programming courses to help build a solid foundation to approach and learn these languages. RMIT also offers an IOS programming course which will be highly beneficial to help build these skills and meet the qualifications for the job. </p>
